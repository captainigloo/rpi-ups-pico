.TH PICOD 1
.SH NAME
picod \- Raspberry Pi UPS PIco control daemon.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B picod
.RB [ -d ]
.RB [ -n ]
.RB [ -v ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B picod
creates the pulse train necessary for the Raspberry Pi UPS PIco to work
correctly. This device expects a pulse train on GPIO pin #22 to determine if the
Raspberry Pi it is attached to is booted up. This then influences whether the
firmware will charge the battery - without the pulse train, the device may
appear to work correctly and will even switch over to the battery if power is
lost, but the battery will not be charged, rendering the device quite useless
quite fast.

In addition to this, the daemon monitors pin #27, which is used by the PIco to
indicate that the battery level is critical and the system needs to shut down.
The PIco sets this pin to HIGH during normal operation, and LOW to indicate this
condition. Upon receiving this signal, the daemon calls "shutdown -h now" to try
and shut down gracefully. Power will be cut shortly after, so this is necessary.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B -d
Fork to the background.
.TP
.B -n
Do not monitor pin #27 for the FSSD trigger. Use this if you intend to monitor
the battery state out of band and take appropriate action, OR if you set up your
system in a way that makes it resilient to sudden power cuts.
.TP
.B -v
Print the version and then exit.
.SH BUGS
The original manual incorrectly states that the pulse train has to be on pin #27
and the FSSD signal is on pin #22. The Python script accompanying the firmware
package on the other hand uses pin #22 for the pulse train and #27 for the FSSD
signal, so this daemon follows suit.

Also, the daemon terminates upon receiving the FSSD signal. This is in line with
what the original Python script does, but it may be smarter to instead check if
pin #27 is HIGH and control whether the pulse train is generated based on that,
as it will be HIGH during normal operation.
